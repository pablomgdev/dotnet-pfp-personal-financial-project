## Description
A project for managing expenses and income to easily keep track of personal finances.

## About the Project

### Technologies
- **ASP.NET Core 8**
- **PostgreSQL 16.1**
- **Docker**

### Architecture
The architecture of this project is inspired by **Hexagonal Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**.

As the project has progressed, certain best practices have been adapted or temporarily adjusted to accelerate implementation. However, a refactoring process is planned to align the code with the original architectural principles.

For now, the focus remains on completing an initial functional version, after which this refactoring could be carried out.
