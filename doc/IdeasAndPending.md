## Ideas
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Extract shared components from Test.Unit and Test.Integration into a separate project (Test.Shared)
- [ ] Add Spanish translations (e.g., exception messages) in the API
- [ ] A  conversational AI client could be created to interact with the backend API and perform operations with it

## Pending
- [ ] Convert outstanding tasks (like TODOs or areas for improvement) into issues so others can contribute
- [ ] Review all TODO comments throughout the project
