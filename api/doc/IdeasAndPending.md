## Ideas
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Extract shared components from Test.Unit and Test.Integration into a separate project (Test.Shared)
- [ ]  Add Spanish translations (e.g., exception messages) in the API

## Pending
- [ ] Convert outstanding tasks (like TODOs or areas for improvement) into issues so others can contribute
- [ ] Review all TODO comments throughout the project
